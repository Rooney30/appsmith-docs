# Widget Errors

This section would help you troubleshoot common widget errors on the Appsmith platform.

## Execution errors
You may see below errors when executing an [API](../../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/authentication/)/[Query](../../core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/querying-a-database/)/[JS object](../../core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-editor-beta/) using a widget property.

### Sync fields can't execute async framework actions

You may see this error when binding an [API](../../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/authentication/)/[Query](../../core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/querying-a-database/)/[JS Object](../../core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-editor-beta/) execution to a widget property that expects data, and can't be used to trigger an action. 

#### Error message
You would see one of the below error messages based on API/Query or a JS Object function execution.

> Found a reference to {{action}} during evaluation. Sync fields cannot execute async framework actions. Please remove any direct/indirect references to {{action}} and try again.

 or 

> Found a Promise() during evaluation. Sync fields cannot execute asynchronous code.


**To-Do to add screenshot**

#### Cause
**Action** refers to the execution of an [API](../../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/authentication/)/[Query](../../core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/querying-a-database/)/[JS object](../../core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-editor-beta/). 

Action can only be performed by binding it to an [async](../../core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#async-fields) field. When you bind an action to a [sync](../../core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#sync-fields) field that only expects data it throws an error.

For example, you are executing a `storeValue()` function in a `TableData` property of a table. The 'TableData` property expects data and can't execute a function, so throws an error.

> Found a reference to `storeValue` during evaluation. Sync fields can't execute async framework actions. 
Please remove any direct/indirect references to `storeValue` and try again.

Similarly, if you try to execute a JS Object function `<JSOBJECT_NAME.FUNCTION_NAME>` in the `TableData` property, it again throws an error:

> Found a Promise() during evaluation. Sync fields cannot execute asynchronous code

#### Solution
You would have to invoke the [`.data` property](../../core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#use-case) of an API/query/JS object. 

For example, you have an API ```getFullNameOfLoggedInUser``` that returns a user's full name, and you wish to add the user's name based on the logged-in user to show a welcome text, `Welcome! <LOGGED_IN_USER_NAME>`. 

You could bind the response generated by the API `getFullNameOfLoggedInUser` to a text widget by calling the `.data` property, and add the below code snippet in a mustache (`{{}}`) sign.

```
getFullNameOfLoggedInUser.data
```

Similarly, you could invoke the `.data` property for API/Query/JS Object to create [complex workflows](../../core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#use-an-async-function-response-in-a-sync-field). 

## JSON form errors

You may see the below errors when working with a [JSON Form ](../../reference/widgets/json-form)widget.

### Source data exceeds 50 fields

You see an error message **Source data exceeds 50 fields. Please update the source data** when you try to bind the query/API response to the [source data ](../../reference/widgets/json-form#source-data)property.

#### Error message

Source data exceeds 50 fields. Please update the source data.

![When the data had more than 50 fields](</img/Troubleshooting__Widget_Errors__JSON_Form_Errors__Source_Exceeds_50_Fields.png>)

#### Cause

The problem can be caused when you are trying to bind:

* A large array of multiple JSON objects
* A huge JSON object which has a lot of fields
* The whole query data rather than a selected row or triggered row in a table

#### Solution

To determine if the problem is caused due to:

* **A large array or a huge JSON object** - You can re-look at the data and evaluate the need to display all the data on UI, as it would be painful for your users to navigate more than 50 fields.
* **The whole query response that you bound to the source data** - You recheck the source data field you are trying to bind and select either the selected row / triggered row to bind.

Once you have figured out the new structure for the data, head to the [source data](../../reference/widgets/json-form#source-data) field to make changes.
