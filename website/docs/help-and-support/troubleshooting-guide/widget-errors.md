# Widget errors

This section would help you troubleshoot common widget errors on the Appsmith platform.

## JSON form errors

You may see the below errors when working with a [JSON Form ](../../reference/widgets/json-form)widget.

### Source data exceeds 50 fields

You see an error message **Source data exceeds 50 fields. Please update the source data** when you try to bind the query/API response to the [source data ](../../reference/widgets/json-form#source-data)property.

#### Error message

Source data exceeds 50 fields. Please update the source data.

![When the data had more than 50 fields](</img/Troubleshooting__Widget_Errors__JSON_Form_Errors__Source_Exceeds_50_Fields.png>)

#### Cause

The problem can be caused when you are trying to bind:

* A large array of multiple JSON objects
* A huge JSON object which has a lot of fields
* The whole query data rather than a selected row or triggered row in a table

#### Solution

To determine if the problem is caused due to:

* **A large array or a huge JSON object** - You can re-look at the data and evaluate the need to display all the data on UI, as it would be painful for your users to navigate more than 50 fields.
* **The whole query response that you bound to the source data** - You recheck the source data field you are trying to bind and select either the selected row / triggered row to bind.

Once you have figured out the new structure for the data, head to the [source data](../../reference/widgets/json-form#source-data) field to make changes.

## Query/API/JS object execution errors
You may see below errors when executing an [API](../../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/authentication/)/[Query](../../core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/querying-a-database/)/[JS object](../../core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-editor-beta/) using a widget property.

### Action can't be triggered
You may see this error when binding an [API](../../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/authentication/)/[Query](../../core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/querying-a-database/)/[JS object](../../core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-editor-beta/) execution to a widget property that expects data, and can't be used to trigger an action. 

#### Error message
Action cannot be triggered from this field.

**To-Do to add screenshot**

#### Cause
**Action** refers to the execution of an [API](../../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/authentication/)/[Query](../../core-concepts/data-access-and-binding/querying-a-database/)/[JS object](../../core-concepts/writing-code/javascript-editor-beta/). 

Action can only be performed by binding it to an [async](../../core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#async-fields) field. When you bind an action to a [sync](../../core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#sync-fields) field that only expects data, the `action cannot be triggered from this field` error is thrown.

#### Solution
You could resolve the error by invoking a [`.data` property](../../core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#use-case) of an API/query/JS object. For example, you have an API ```getFullNameOfLoggedInUser``` that returns a user's full name, and you wish to add the user's name based on the logged-in user to show a welcome text, `Welcome! <LOGGED_IN_USER_NAME>`. You could bind the response generated by the API `getFullNameOfLoggedInUser` to a text widget by calling the `.data` property. You could add the below code snippet in a mustache (`{{}}`) to the text property of the text widget instead of `getFullNameOfLoggedInUser.run()`.

```
getFullNameOfLoggedInUser.data
```
Similarly, you could invoke the `.data` property for API/Query/JS Object in the [complex workflows](../../core-concepts/writing-code/workflows#use-an-async-function-response-in-a-sync-field).
